/// The `connect_sdk_client_flutter` library is a Flutter plugin that allows Flutter apps for Android and iOS to integrate with the Connect Gateway.
/// It does this by providing a bridge between the Flutter codebase and the existing Android/Swift native SDKs.
/// This bridge is structured similar to the structure of the Android and Swift SDK.
/// [ConnectSDK] provides an entrypoint into the SDK.
/// This needs to be initialized using a [ConnectSDKConfiguration] and a [PaymentConfiguration].
/// After initialization, execute API calls using the [ClientApi] or prepare a payment using [ConnectSDK.encryptPaymentRequest]
